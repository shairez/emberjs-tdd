Ember.js TDD / BDD example project [OUTDATED]
==============================================

The purpose of this project **was** to be a constantly updated repository of best practices in TDD (Test driven development) our Ember applications. (But I've since moved to Angular back in 2012)

I created it because back then I didn't find any resource about Testing and Ember. 

So I keep it here for nostalgic purposes, feel free to move on to a more updated repo.
