Ember.js TDD / BDD example project
==============================================

The purpose of this project is to be a constantly updated repository of best practices in TDD (Test driven development) our Ember applications.

If anyone got a suggestion on how to test ember views, models, routes or controllers, please submit a pull request so we can build a better workflow for developing our ember apps.

The libraries I use for this project are: [Requirejs](http://requirejs.org/) and [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/). 

## A note about the current version:  
 
 It's not complete, it's not good as it should be, but it's a start, so please comment and suggest improvements as much as possible.
